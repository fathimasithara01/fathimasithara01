## Hey there, I'm fathima sithara

I'm a backend developer who accidentally fell in love with **Golang** — and never looked back.  
What started as a curiosity quickly turned into an obsession for writing clean, fast, and scalable APIs.

###  What I do
-  Building backend systems in **Go** (Gin, GORM, MySQL, JWT, Clean Architecture)
-  Implementing secure authentication flows & role-based access control
-  Solving **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems for fun (and pain 😅)
-  Occasionally flexing my frontend side with **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **TailwindCSS**

### What I'm learning
I'm constantly leveling up my skills in:
- Microservices in Go
- gRPC & Protobuf
- Writing better tests and deploying clean CI/CD pipelines
- Designing scalable, production-ready architectures

###  Current mission:
Build complete, modular backend projects in Go that feel like they were crafted by a team — not a solo developer. (Even though I am one 👨‍💻)

---

>  Fun fact: I write code like I write messages — clear, a little quirky, and straight to the point.

Let's connect and share what we're building!  
Feel free to check out my projects, or reach out if you love Go as much as I do 🤝
